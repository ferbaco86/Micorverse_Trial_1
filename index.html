        Winfrey was born into poverty in rural Mississippi to a teenage single mother and later raised in inner-city Milwaukee.
        She has stated that she was molested during her childhood and early teens and became pregnant at 14;
        her son was born prematurely and died in infancy.
        Winfrey was then sent to live with the man she calls her father, Vernon Winfrey, a barber in Tennessee, and landed a job in radio while still in high school.
        By 19, she was a co-anchor for the local evening news. Winfrey's often emotional, extemporaneous delivery eventually led to her transfer to the daytime talk show arena,
        and after boosting a third-rated local Chicago talk show to first place, she launched her own production company and became internationally syndicated.
